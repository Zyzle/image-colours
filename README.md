# Image Colours

The code in this repository is the basis for a series of blog posts from my site where we look at how to find dominant colours in an image which can be found here:

 * [Finding Colours - Part 1: This should be easy...right?](https://zyzle.dev/blog/colour-finder-1/)
 * [Finding Colours - Part 2: Maths is hard](https://zyzle.dev/blog/colour-finder-2/)
 * [Finding Colours - Part 3: WebAssembly to the rescue](https://zyzle.dev/blog/colour-finder-3/)

 The 3 folders in the repo contain the following:

 ### js-based

 This is the pure JavaScript-based version of the app 

 ### wasm-based

 This is the app running in JavaScript but with a WebAssembly module to do the heavy lifting

 ### colors-wasm

 This is the WebAssembly module used in the wasm-based code example
